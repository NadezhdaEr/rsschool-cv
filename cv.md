#### ___About Myself___:
Graduated from a technical university with a degree in biotechnology. During the training, modeling processes with the writing of various programs were always involved. Then I was engaged in scientific research related to modeling: various calculations of chemical compounds, searching for the relationship between the structure of a molecule and their biological properties. Later, I was engaged in applied things in production, but my creative nature and thirst for new knowledge did not allow me to sit still. Thus, I became interested in analytics, and then, learning various ways of visualizing data, I delved into the world of programming.

Realizing that programming allows you to work remotely and will allow you to get additional career opportunities, all this encourages you to learn about this area. In addition, there are a huge number of free high-quality resources for self-education.

I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me become a software engineer.
